SWARM
=====

A simple space shooter game made with C++ and SFML

# SWARM 0.9
This is an independently developed, cross-platform space-shooter/bullet hell game designed to overload your senses with bright and shiny graphics and loud and pulsing sound! It's inspired by classics, like Starfox 64 and Gunstar Heroes, and has a fresh colorful and gritty art style.

# 1.0 Milestone
I will reach 1.0 when the game is at a coin-op machine level. ~15 minutes of play; one boss battle complete with transitions; functioning title menu, basic options menu, and game-over screen; bug-free.

# Engine and Dependencies
SWARM is developed with a custom engine (Adytum) with help from:

SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
TinyXML-2 (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/)
Generic Math Template Library (http://ggt.sourceforge.net/html/main.html)
